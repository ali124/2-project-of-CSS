    The Roaring Lion Came

    The noise was deeper than a tribal drum,<br />
    but constant and ancient.<br />

    It rumbled out a fearful warning<br />
    and it came across the orange land,<br />
    its maker hidden in the swaying grass.<br />

    "Run, run the lions here!" A voice called out.<br />

    Then the silence of a hunter as it ran,<br />
    paws pressing down the sand,<br />
    and up upon a rocky outcrop<br />
    high above the rolling plains appeared<br />
    a noble king his mane a crown of furry gold.<br />

    All the men and woman stopped and stared.<br />

    He raised his head, pushed out his chest<br />
    and roared into the sun, the<br />
    sound a terrifying scream<br />
    of fangs and quakes and<br />
    as it grew the earth began to shake.<br />
